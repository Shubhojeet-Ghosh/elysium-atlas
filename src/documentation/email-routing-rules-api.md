# Email Routing Rules API — Department Router Guide

Define **when** inbound email threads should be routed to a **department**, using natural-language conditions evaluated by the LLM in the **AI Department Router** flow node.

Rules are scoped to **`team_id`**. Each rule points at a **`department_id`** and includes a **`routing_prompt`** — the condition the LLM uses at runtime.

For creating departments, see [departments-api.md](./departments-api.md).  
For the flow node that consumes these rules, see [email-flow-plan.md](./email-flow-plan.md) §5.3 **AI Department Router**.

## When to use these APIs

| Action          | API                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Create a rule   | `POST /email-routing-rules/v1/create`          |
| Update a rule   | `POST /email-routing-rules/v1/update`          |
| List team rules | `POST /email-routing-rules/v1/list-team-rules` |
| Delete a rule   | `POST /email-routing-rules/v1/delete`          |

No `Authorization` header required (prototype).

**Typical setup:**

```
1. Create departments     →  POST /email-departments/v1/create
2. Create routing rules   →  one rule per routing condition (same or different departments)
3. Flow runs on inbound   →  AI Department Router loads active rules for team_id → LLM picks department
4. Thread updated         →  email-threads.department_id set → members see thread in their dept inbox
```

**Independent from recipient rules:** Routing only picks a department for the thread. It does **not** limit who can appear on CC/BCC — see [email-recipient-rules-api.md](./email-recipient-rules-api.md).

## Recommended fields (beyond department + prompt)

Your core idea (`team_id` + `department_id` + natural-language condition) is the right shape. We also store:

| Field                | Why                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`rule_name`**      | Short label for admin UI (“Route refund emails”)                                              |
| **`routing_prompt`** | Natural-language **when** to route to this department (LLM condition)                         |
| **`priority`**       | Lower number = listed first for the LLM (default `100`). Helps when several rules could match |
| **`is_fallback`**    | One rule per team can be the catch-all when nothing else matches                              |
| **`status`**         | `active` \| `inactive` — disable without deleting                                             |

**Not stored on the rule (resolved at runtime):** department **name** / **description** — loaded from `email-departments` when building the LLM prompt.

**Future (not in MVP API):** `example_snippets[]` for few-shot routing, `agent_id` scope for per-agent overrides.

## How the LLM router uses rules (runtime — flow engine)

When the **AI Department Router** node runs:

1. Load all **`status: active`** rules for `team_id` via internal service (same data as list API).
2. Join **`department_name`** + **`department_description`** from `email-departments`.
3. Build LLM prompt:
   - Thread summary + latest inbound message
   - Numbered list of rules: `{ rule_name, department_name, routing_prompt, priority }`
   - Instruction: pick **one** `department_id`, return JSON `{ department_id, reason, confidence }`
4. If no rule matches and a rule has **`is_fallback: true`**, use that department.
5. Set **`email-threads.department_id`** on the thread.

**Example rules for one team:**

| priority | department | routing_prompt (short)                                     |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10       | Sales      | Customer asks about pricing, demo, or enterprise plan      |
| 20       | Support    | Technical issue, bug, or how-to question                   |
| 100      | General    | `is_fallback: true` — “When no other rule clearly applies” |

## Frontend UX

| Screen                 | Action                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing rules list** | `list-team-rules` — table of rule_name, department, priority, active                                                  |
| **Add rule**           | Pick department dropdown + textarea for `routing_prompt`                                                              |
| **Fallback toggle**    | One rule marked “Default / fallback department” → `is_fallback: true`                                                 |
| **Workflow node**      | **AI Department Router** shows count of active rules for team (read-only); rules edited here, not duplicated on agent |

## Example: create Sales + Support rules

```javascript
const BASE = "http://localhost:7000/elysium-agents";

async function createRoutingRule(
  teamId,
  departmentId,
  ruleName,
  routingPrompt,
  priority = 100,
) {
  const res = await fetch(`${BASE}/email-routing-rules/v1/create`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      team_id: teamId,
      department_id: departmentId,
      rule_name: ruleName,
      routing_prompt: routingPrompt,
      priority,
      is_fallback: false,
    }),
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  if (!data.success) throw new Error(data.message);
  return data.rule;
}

// Sales — priority 10
await createRoutingRule(
  "team_123",
  "674a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345",
  "Sales inquiries",
  "Route when the customer asks about pricing, quotes, demos, or purchasing.",
  10,
);

// Support — priority 20
await createRoutingRule(
  "team_123",
  "674b2c3d4e5f6789012346",
  "Technical support",
  "Route when the customer reports a bug, error, login issue, or needs technical help.",
  20,
);

// Fallback — priority 100
await createRoutingRule(
  "team_123",
  "674c3d4e5f6789012347",
  "General inbox",
  "Use when no other routing rule clearly applies.",
  100,
  // set is_fallback: true in body for the last call
);
```
