# Agent APIs — team RBAC (frontend guide)

Short reference for the **Elysium Agents** agent routes after team-based access was added.

**Base path:** `/elysium-agents/elysium-atlas/agent`

All authenticated routes expect `Authorization: Bearer <session_jwt>`. The JWT must include `user_id`, `team_id`, and `role` (see [backend-team-rbac-guide.md](./backend-team-rbac-guide.md)).

## What changed

| Before                                      | After                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agents scoped to **user** (`owner_user_id`) | Agents scoped to **team** (`team_id` from JWT)                            |
| Only the creator could access their agents  | **All team members** can **view** team agents                             |
| Owner-only checks on some routes            | **Owner + admin** can **create / edit / delete**; **member** is read-only |

`list-agents` now returns every agent for the JWT’s active `team_id`, not just agents created by the logged-in user.

## Roles

| Role     | Agent access                                                                             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner`  | Full — create, edit, delete, view                                                        |
| `admin`  | Full — create, edit, delete, view                                                        |
| `member` | **View only** — list and read config/knowledge; cannot create, update, upload, or delete |

Use JWT `role` to **disable UI controls** (buttons, inputs, upload zones). The backend **re-checks membership/role in MongoDB** on every request — UI gating alone is not enough.

## API permissions

### Read — owner, admin, member

User must be an active member of the **agent’s team** (resolved from the agent document, not only JWT `team_id`).

| Endpoint                           | Description                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `POST /v1/list-agents`             | List all agents for the active team |
| `POST /v1/get-agent-details`       | Full agent config/details           |
| `POST /v1/get-agent-urls`          | Paginated indexed URLs              |
| `POST /v1/get-agent-files`         | Paginated uploaded files            |
| `POST /v1/get-agent-custom-texts`  | Paginated custom texts              |
| `POST /v1/get-agent-qa-pairs`      | Paginated QA pairs                  |
| `POST /v1/get-custom-text-content` | Custom text body from vector store  |
| `POST /v1/get-qa-pair-content`     | QA pair body from vector store      |

### Write — owner and admin only

| Endpoint                              | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /v1/pre-build-agent-operations` | Create agent shell (name, initial config)    |
| `POST /v1/generate-presigned-urls`    | S3 upload URLs for files/icons               |
| `POST /v1/build-agent`                | Index links/files/knowledge (build pipeline) |
| `POST /v1/update-agent`               | Update agent metadata and re-index           |
| `POST /v1/delete-agent`               | Delete agent and related data                |
| `POST /v1/remove-agent-links`         | Remove indexed URLs                          |
| `POST /v1/delete-agent-files`         | Remove uploaded files                        |
| `POST /v1/delete-agent-custom-data`   | Remove custom texts / QA pairs               |

**Tool linking:** `pre-build-agent-operations`, `build-agent`, and `update-agent` accept optional `tool_ids: string[]` — Mongo `_id` values from team tools in `atlas_tools`. See [frontend-tools-api-guide.md](./frontend-tools-api-guide.md#agent-linking-tool_ids).

### Unchanged (not part of team RBAC)

| Endpoint                          | Notes                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `POST /v1/get-agent-fields`       | **No JWT** — used by widget/visitor flows |
| `POST /v1/query-agent`            | Chat/query — separate plan/usage checks   |
| `POST /v1/rotate-conversation-id` | Public chat session helper                |
| `POST /v1/mark-chat-message-read` | Public chat helper                        |

## Frontend UI checklist

When `role === "member"`:

- **Hide or disable:** Create agent, Save/Update, Build/Re-index, Delete agent, file upload, add/remove links, add/remove custom knowledge, delete files/links/knowledge.
- **Keep enabled:** Agent list, agent detail/settings **view**, knowledge base **view** (URLs, files, texts, QA lists and content).
- **Read-only mode:** Prefer disabling entire forms/sections rather than individual fields — all write APIs above return 403 for members.

When `role === "owner"` or `role === "admin"`:

- Full agent management for agents belonging to the team.

When JWT has **no `team_id`** (user has not selected a team):

- Do not call agent APIs; redirect to team selection first.

## Error responses

| Status | Message                                                            | When                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `401`  | Token invalid/expired                                              | Missing or bad JWT                    |
| `403`  | `No team context. Select a team to continue.`                      | JWT missing `team_id`                 |
| `403`  | `You are not a member of this team.`                               | User removed or wrong team (list)     |
| `403`  | `You are not authorized to access this agent.`                     | Read — not on agent’s team            |
| `403`  | `You are not authorized to modify this agent.`                     | Write — member or not on agent’s team |
| `403`  | `You are not authorized to create or modify agents for this team.` | Create flow — member role             |

Always handle `403` gracefully; do not rely only on JWT `role` — membership can change after login.

## Quick reference

```
member  → can call all READ endpoints
member  → cannot call any WRITE endpoints

owner   → READ + WRITE
admin   → READ + WRITE
```

For related team-member management (invite/remove), see the Express Atlas API docs referenced in [backend-team-rbac-guide.md](./backend-team-rbac-guide.md).
